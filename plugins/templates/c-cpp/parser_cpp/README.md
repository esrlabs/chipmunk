# C++ Parser Plugin Template

This is a starter template for developing parser plugins in C++.

The generated API bindings are in C. This template demonstrates how to use these C bindings directly and does not create an additional C++ abstraction layer over the API.

Copy this template to quickly begin a new plugin project. For detailed instructions, refer to the [Step-by-Step Guide](../README.md).
