# Chipmunk Development CLI Tool

This CLI Tool provides an easier way to manage various development tasks for Chipmunk.
Chipmunk consists of multiple modules with complex dependencies on each other, and this tool helps streamline the development process by coordinating these tasks seamlessly.
This tool acts as a cargo extension. Once installed, you can access it by running `cargo chipmunk <COMMAND> <ARGS>` from anywhere within the repository.

## Build/Installation

### Prerequisites

Before installing the Chipmunk CLI tool, ensure that Rust is installed on your system. If Rust is not yet installed, follow the official installation instructions for your platform:

- **Install Rust:** Visit [rustup.rs](https://rustup.rs/) and follow the instructions to install Rust.

### Install Chipmunk CLI

Navigate to the root directory of the Chipmunk repository in your terminal and run the following command to install the Chipmunk CLI tool:

```bash
cargo install --path cli
```

This command installs this tool as a cargo extension, allowing you to use `cargo chipmunk <COMMAND> <ARGS>` to execute various development tasks for Chipmunk.


## Usage

This CLI tool provides multiple sub-commands for different tasks, with each sub-command offering various arguments.

### General Commands Overview

### Build Command 

```bash
Usage: cargo chipmunk build [OPTIONS] [TARGET]...

Arguments:
  [TARGET]...
          Target to build, by default whole application will be built

          Possible values:
          - core:    Represents the path `application/apps/indexer`
          - shared:  Represents the path `application/platform`
          - binding: Represents the path `application/apps/rustcore/rs-bindings`
          - wrapper: Represents the path `application/apps/rustcore/ts-bindings`
          - wasm:    Represents the path `application/apps/rustcore/wasm-bindings`
          - client:  Represents the path `application/client`
          - updater: Represents the path `application/apps/precompiled/updater`
          - app:     Represents the path `application/holder`
          - cli:     Represents the path `cli`

Options:
  -p, --production
          Build release version

  -f, --fail-fast
          Stops execution immediately if any job fails.

  -u, --ui-mode <UI_MODE>
          Specifies the UI options for displaying command logs and progress in the terminal

          [default: bars]

          Possible values:
          - bars:      Displays progress bars, showing the current line of the output of each command. [aliases: 'b']
          - report:    Displays progress bars and prints a summary of all command logs to stdout after all jobs have finished. [aliases: 'r']
          - print:     Outputs each job's result to stdout once the job finishes. No progress bars are displayed. [aliases: 'p']
          - immediate: Outputs logs immediately as they are produced, which may cause overlapping logs for parallel jobs. No progress bars are displayed. [aliases: 'i']

  -h, --help
          Print help (see a summary with '-h')
```

## Shell Completion

The Chipmunk CLI tool supports shell completion for various shells. You can generate shell completions and print them to `stdout` using the following command:

```bash
cargo chipmunk shell-completion <SHELL>
```
Replace `<SHELL>` with the name of your shell (e.g., bash, zsh, fish, powershell).

To use shell completion, you can redirect the output of the completion command to a file and save the file to the appropriate shell completion directory.

After installing the completion script, restart your shell session or source the completion file to enable shell completion for the Chipmunk CLI tool.


### Example: Bash Shell
To enable bash shell completion, run the following command to generate the completion script and save it to a file:

```bash
cargo chipmunk shell-completion bash > chipmunk-completion.bash
```
Next, copy the chipmunk-completion.bash file to your bash completion directory (typically  ~/.bash_completion.d/ or /etc/bash_completion.d/).

## Contributing

Contributions in any part of Chipmunk are very welcome!

After making any changes to this build CLI tool, please run the integration tests to ensure that all the provided commands in this tool are still working as expected. Additionally, consider adding new tests when introducing new features and commands.

To run all the tests, execute the Python file `chipmunk/cli/integration_tests/run_all.py` from within the `chipmunk/cli` directory. For example:

```bash
# Move to cli directory
cd cli
# Run python file
python ./integration_tests/run_all.py
```
Please be aware that these tests will run on your local copy of Chipmunk. This process will rebuild the project and run all linting and tests on the entire solution.
