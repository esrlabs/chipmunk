/**
 * Allows creating row parser, which will bound with plugin's host.
 * It means: this row parser will be applied only to data, which was
 * received from plugin's host.
 * It also means: usage of this kind of plugin makes sense only if plugin has
 * host part (backend part), which delivery some data. A good example would be:
 * serial port plugin. Host part extracts data from serial port and sends into
 * stream; render (this kind of plugin) applies only to data, which were gotten
 * from serial port.
 * @usecases decoding stream output content; converting stream output into human-readable format
 * @requirements TypeScript or JavaScript
 * @examples Base64string parser, HEX converting into a string and so on
