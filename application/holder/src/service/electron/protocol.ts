     * - `404 Not Found` if the file does not exist or is inaccessible.

     *   URL and resolved to a filesystem path using `url.fileURLToPath`. This preserves
     *   Windows backslashes and prevents scheme confusion.
     * - Files are streamed via `fs.createReadStream` to support large attachments
     *   without buffering them entirely into memory.
     * - The response includes `Content-Type`, `Content-Length`, and
     *   `Content-Disposition` headers, as well as `Accept-Ranges` and
     *   `Cache-Control: no-store` for predictable client behavior.
     * - Fetching `file://` directly is not supported by Node’s `fetch` (undici),
     *   hence files are read and streamed manually.
