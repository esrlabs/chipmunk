# Contributing to Chipmunk

Thank you for your interest in contributing to Chipmunk! This document provides a guide to setting up your development environment and making contributions. Chipmunk is developed using [Rust](https://www.rust-lang.org/) for the backend processing and [ElectronJS](https://www.electronjs.org/) for the frontend application.

## Where to Start

To make the process as smooth as possible, we've split the documentation into several key areas. If you are a new contributor, we recommend reading them in order.

* **[1. Getting Started](./getting-started.md)** Your first stop. This guide walks you through installing all the necessary tools and dependencies to set up your local development environment.

* **[2. Development Guide](./development-guide.md)** Once you're set up, this guide covers the daily workflow. Learn how to build, run, test, and lint the application. It also explains our process for submitting a pull request.

* **[3. Debugging](./debugging.md)** If you run into issues or need to understand what's happening under the hood, this guide provides information on log files, configurations, and common troubleshooting steps.
